# Max CSV / TSV Tools
Version 0.7

by Adam Murray

Latest version: https://github.com/adamjmurray/max_csv_tools/archive/master.zip


## INSTALLATION

Put this folder somewhere on your Max search path (see Options -> File Preferences)

Get started with the maxhelp file for cellblock2csv or csv2cellblock


## LIMITATIONS

csv2cellblock only works with tsv (tab separated value) formatted files.
It also doesn't handle tabs inside a spreadsheet cell.

Most spreadsheets can export as tsv, so this should work for the majority of use
cases. If you need to convert a csv to tsv, you can do that for free with Google Spreadsheets.


## ABOUT

This is an add-on for [Cycling '74 Max](https://cycling74.com/max7/)

CSV/TSV is a format supported by spreadsheet programs, so you can use this to edit data
from Max in an application like Excel or OpenOffice.

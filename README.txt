ABOUT

Currently this project consists of one Max abstraction cellblock2csv, which lets you 
export tabular data from Max's cellblock object to a CSV (comma separated value) file.
CSV is a format supported by spreadsheet programs, so you can use this to edit data
from Max in an application like Excel or OpenOffice.

In the future I may add a csv2cellblock object, and perhaps a pair of objects for 
importing and exporting data directly from a Jitter matrix. 
Do you want that? Then send a request to me and I might build it sooner.
